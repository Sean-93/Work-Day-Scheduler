# Work-Day-Scheduler

This is the first Jquery assignment.
## The colors of time slots change depending on what the current hour is from the 9AM to 5PM slot.

## You can save notes with local storage for each of the time slots.

#### This was made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.  Some styles came from Bootstrap, and some of the code originated from Moment.JS.
